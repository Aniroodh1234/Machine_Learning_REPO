    "1)PMF – Probability Mass Function\n",
    "    In-depth Meaning:\n",
    "    PMF describes the probability distribution of a discrete random variable.\n",
    "    For a random variable X, PMF gives P(X=x), i.e., the probability that X takes a specific value x. It generally means we will get direct probabilities for specific outcomes.\n",
    "    It works only for discrete values (you can count them, like 0, 1, 2...).\n",
    "\n",
    "📈 Visual Representation:\n",
    "Imagine a bar graph:\n",
    "Each bar height = probability of that discrete value.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧪 Example:\n",
    "Toss a fair coin twice:\n",
    "Possible outcomes (X = number of heads): 0, 1, 2\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X=1) = 1/6\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X=2) = 1/6 and so on...\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Properties:\n",
    "𝑃(X=x) >= 0   #--> this property says that we will get the proibability of a discrete point which will never be 0 \n",

    "∑ P(X=x) = 1   #--> this property says that the sum of all probabilities will be equal to 1\n",
    "\n",
    "while constructing a PMF graph, we can use the following steps:\n",
    "1. **Identify the Random Variable**: Determine the discrete random variable you are interested in.\n",
    "2. **List Possible Outcomes**: Enumerate all possible values the random variable can take.\n",
    "3. here we have parameters like p,q,k. k is the outcome if k=1 then its success or its 0 then its failure, p is the probability of success, and q is the probability of failure.\n",
    "4. **Calculate Probabilities**: Use the PMF formula to calculate the probability for each outcome.\n",
    "    the PMF formula is given by:\n",
    "    pmf = p^k * (1-p)^(1-k)   [this is for bernouli distribution]\n",

    "1) PDF – Probability Density Function\n",
    "    In-depth Meaning:\n",
    "    PDF is used for continuous variables (uncountably infinite values like time, height, weight).\n",
    "    The PDF does not give a probability directly. Instead, it gives a density, and you get probabilities by finding the area under the curve between two points.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    🧪 Example:\n",
    "    Suppose human heights follow a normal distribution with mean 170 cm and standard deviation 10 cm:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The PDF tells you how “likely” any height is, but the actual probability of being exactly 170 cm = 0.\n",
    "    Instead, you'd ask: What's the probability of being between 160 and 180 cm? → That's an area under the curve.\n",

    "\n",
    "    ∫[−∞ to ∞] f(x) dx = 1   #--> this property says that the total area under the curve will always be equal to 1\n",

    "1. **Choose a Distribution**: Decide on the type of distribution (e.g., normal, uniform, exponential).\n",
    "2. **Define Parameters**: Set the parameters for the distribution (e.g., mean and standard deviation for a normal distribution).\n",
    "3. **Generate Data Points**: Create a range of x-values (e.g., from -3 to 3 for a standard normal distribution).\n",
