In this repo, I’ve put together implementations of Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, and Polynomial Regression both from scratch and using Python libraries. My goal was to really get a grip on how these models work, starting from the math behind them all the way to writing code for training, testing, and visualizing results. Each script walks through the process step by step with example datasets, and I’ve added plots to clearly show how the models fit the data.
